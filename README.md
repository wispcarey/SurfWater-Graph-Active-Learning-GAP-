# SurfWater-Graph-Active-Learning-GAP-
This is a novel graph active learning method to detect surface water and sediment pixel in multispectral satellite images. We developed a graph active learning pipeline, called GAP to do this task.

Some codes here are copied from or modified based on [Kevin Miller's Model-Change Active Learning repository](https://github.com/millerk22/model-change-paper "Model Change Paper") and [Deep Water Map](https://github.com/isikdogan/deepwatermap "Deep Water Map source codes"). Besides, we applied some functions in [Jeff Calder's graph learning package](https://github.com/jwcalder/GraphLearning "Graph Learning Package").

Our experiment are based on the [RiverPIXELS dataset](https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/doi:10.15485/1865732 "RiverPIXELS") created by Jon Schwenk in Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).
